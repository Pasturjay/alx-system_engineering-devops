## Introduction
This is 0x09 Web Infrastructure Design project! This project aims to provide an understanding of the fundamental concepts of web infrastructure, including how various components interact to ensure a robust and scalable web application.

## Concepts

### DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. DNS is essential for the functionality of the internet, as it allows users to access websites using easily memorable names instead of complex numerical IP addresses.

### Monitoring
Monitoring involves tracking the performance and health of your web infrastructure. This includes monitoring server uptime, response times, error rates, and resource utilization. Effective monitoring helps identify and resolve issues before they impact users, ensuring high availability and reliability of the web application.

### Web Server
A web server is software that serves web pages to users upon request. It handles HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and delivers static or dynamic content. Common web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS. Web servers are crucial for delivering the content that users interact with on the web.

### Network Basics
Network basics cover the fundamental concepts of how data is transmitted over a network. This includes understanding IP addresses, subnets, routers, switches, and firewalls. A solid grasp of networking principles is necessary to design and manage an efficient web infrastructure.

### Load Balancer
A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. Load balancing enhances the availability and reliability of a web application by spreading the load, improving response times, and ensuring fault tolerance.

### Server
A server is a powerful computer that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers can perform various roles, including hosting web applications, databases, email, and more. Understanding server configurations and management is key to maintaining a responsive and scalable web infrastructure.
